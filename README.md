# martinWoodshow
Website with pictures of woodworking projects created by the Martin family

Basic website to learn about Github, SourceTree, and version control in general.  Very inexperienced at this.
Goal is to have a basic website with several pictures relating to different items created in the Martin Woodshop.

...Probably going to look like a mess and crash any browser trying to load the page.
